To Understand this repository Please read "READMe.md" file.

In this repository, I have posted the task-1 that I completed during my Web Developement Internship at "CodSoft".

I have completed Web Developement Internship 'Task 1', which involves creating a "Landing Page" using HTML,CSS,JavaScript & Bootstrap. 
where I've incorporated Responsive design for Landing page of 'www.shop.com'.
I have now posted it in the repository.<br>
HTML filename = shop.html<br>
CSS filename = shop_website_style.css<br>
this task involves too many images, so I better uploaded those all images in repository.
you have to read html code to understand which images belongs to this task.  <br>
